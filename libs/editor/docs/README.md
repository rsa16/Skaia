*P.S. The editor is currently being used as a demo to test out the engine's feature as they are being added. Currently the demo has a basic moving rectangle controlled by arrow keys. The rectangle has components `S_Sprite`, `S_Input`, and `S_Transform`. The demo has a custom movement system that uses `S_Input` and `S_Transform` to move the rectangle by adjusting the transform component's x and y variables. The `S_RenderSystem` automatically updates the rectangle on each frame.*
